<h1><b> Our Story </b></h1>
<p><b>

Established in 2019, Save The Planet is a company rooted in environmental<br/> 
advocacy,founded by a group of like-minded individuals in the UAE. Our mission<br/>
is to contribute to the well-being of Mother Nature and create a better Earth for <br/>
current and future generations. We specialize in providing sustainable, <br/>
eco-friendly, biodegradable, and compostable products sourced globally.<br/>
<br/>
Save The Planet offers a curated selection of sustainable essentials, <br/>
meticulously chosen by our expert team. Our product range includes unique <br/>
items such as Plantable Stationery, Reusable Bags, and Eco-friendly <br/>
disposables, catering to a wide audience with options ranging from <br/>
simple everyday items to luxurious, beautifully designed pieces.</b></p>

<h1>Our Vision</h1>
<p><b>

We feel deeply connected to our roots and believe that whatever we do should <br/>
add value to our planet and not deplete/degrade its resources. We are committed <br/>
towards restoring the balance between nature and human existence. We aim to connect <br/>
with like-minded individuals who wish to achieve the same. The need to foster zero-waste <br/>
solutions and also empower communities to change their mindset on sustainability is <br/>
paramount. We endeavor to create more products that care for the environment as much <br/>
as they tend to care for you.  At Save The Planet, our team members work for the welfare <br/>
and well-being of the human life and everything connected to it.</p></b>

<h1>Key To A Greener Planet</h1>
<p><b>

Companies often claim to provide 100% natural products but one ever tells the customers<br/>
 how the products are actually manufactured. We at Save The Planet understand the need <br/>
that our buyers must be made aware of the manufacturing process of the products they are<br/>
 buying i.e. what actually goes into making them.<br/>
<br/>
We at Save The Planet go an extra mile to provide you with essentials that are responsibly<br/>
 sourced keeping in mind that sustainability is key for our future survival. More than <br/>
being Eco-friendly our aim should be to achieve a Zero Waste lifestyle as all the natural <br/>
resources on this earth are finite and exploitation of the environment will lead to our ruin.</p></b>

<h1>Protecting Our Planet</h1>
<p><b>

Nature provides us with everything we need to survive. We are the first generation to know <br/>
we’re destroying the world, and we are probably the last that can do anything about it. <br/>
Your one choice can make a difference. Our team are socially aware professionals who feel <br/>
for the cause from deep within and wish to make a difference for the human benefit. We <br/>
educate, promote and encourage people who wish to take up the cause within their community <br/>
and help mankind in making life sustainable for the existing and future generations.<br/>
<br/>
Let’s join hands and swear to eradicate plastic from our lives fully, otherwise there may <br/>
be a time where we won’t be able to breathe, eat or sleep organic and no flora & fauna to <br/>
enjoy. With our dedicated efforts we can reduce our collective carbon footprint and enhance <br/>
quality of life.<br/>
